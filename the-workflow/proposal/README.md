# How to propose something for cataloguing

### Why is a proposal important?

* To ensure that due consideration is given to all our cataloguing work, regardless of resource required
* Document the rationale behind a proposal
* Provide a transparent mechanism for cataloguing priorities
* Encourage cross format proposals - this is particularly important for subject or themed based suggestions
* Encourage collaborative writing and engagement across teams, utilising each others skills and expertise&#x20;
