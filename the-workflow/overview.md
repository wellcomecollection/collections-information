# Overview

The following pages explain the different phases of the cataloguing prioritisation workflow. Some parts of the process will take place all year round, others at specific times; it isn't necessarily a linear process:&#x20;

1. how to discover and find out more about our uncatalogued material
2. how to propose something for cataloguing
3. the decision making process
4. what happens once a proposal is accepted
