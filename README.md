# What is cataloguing prioritisation?

The Collections Information team collect, create, hold and maintain information about our collections, as well as providing access to that information for researchers and visitors. We view this as an iterative process, building up from a minimum viable record to detailed cataloguing and beyond through catalogue enhancements.&#x20;

Uncatalogued collections are a significant barrier to access. Establishing a common set of criteria and a framework to assess the significance and potential of collections is increasingly recognised as an integral element of strategic collections management. It is essential when prioritising resource allocation.&#x20;

Like many long-established archives, libraries and museums, Wellcome has some significant accumulations of material which are not catalogued, or where the finding aids are not available online, and are therefore not easily accessible.&#x20;

We began developing our cataloguing prioritisation framework in 2018. Our aim is to have a flexible workflow and framework that can be applied to all formats within our collections. &#x20;

## Why do we need it?

* To establish a common set of criteria and have a workflow/framework for all formats to assess our uncatalogued material against
* To make our work accountable
* To document and provide evidence for the decisions taken when prioritising resource allocation
* To assess the significance and potential impact of our collections
* To understand where the barriers to access are
* To provide a flexible tool that will enable us to respond to Wellcome strategic priority areas, upcoming exhibitions/events, user demand, and conservation concerns
* To share knowledge and expertise across Wellcome Collection and provide a sense of ownership towards the collection
